# Action RC Ecommerce Project

This project was created while I was learning "Complete React Developer / Zero to Mastery".
The course was purchased from Udemy Academy.
The instructor is Andrei Neagoie from ZTM.

## The Project in a Nutshell

This is a Mock Ecommerce Website which uses Firebase to store the data.

I made some modifications to his project: 
  I used a JSON file to store the Directory images called Category-List.JSON.
  I changed the project type from clothing to Remote Control Vehicles ecommerce website using pictures from Google.
  Using Styled-Components I moved some of the smaller CSS files into their associated Components files.
