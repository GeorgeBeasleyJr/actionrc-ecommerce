# Action RC Ecommerce Project

This project was created while I was learning "Complete React Developer / Zero to Mastery".
The course was purchased from Udemy Academy.
The instructor is Andrei Neagoie from ZTM.

## The Project in a Nutshell

This is a Mock Ecommerce Website which uses Firebase to store the data.

# actionrc-ecommerce

I made some modifications like using a JSON file to store the Home page data.
I also created an RC ecommerce website using pictures from Google.
